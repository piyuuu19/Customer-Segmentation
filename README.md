# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using RFM (Power BI Project)

This project aims to perform **customer segmentation** using the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** method. The analysis process combines several tools to ensure an efficient workflow and produce engaging visualizations.

## 🔄 Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Performed using **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**
   - Includes removing duplicates, handling null values, and correcting data formats and types

2. **Import to Power BI**
   - The cleaned dataset is imported into **Power BI**
   - RFM calculations are performed directly in Power BI using DAX
   - Customers are segmented based on their RFM scores into categories such as:
     - Champions
     - Loyal Customers
     - At Risk
     - and more

3. **Dashboard Design**
   - The layout and background for the dashboard are designed in **Figma**
   - The design is then implemented in Power BI to create a visually appealing and easy-to-understand dashboard

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook → for data cleaning
- Power BI → for RFM calculation and interactive visualization
- Figma → for dashboard layout and design

## 📌 Final Output

- An interactive dashboard displaying customer segmentation based on RFM analysis
- Visual insights that support better marketing decisions based on customer behavior
